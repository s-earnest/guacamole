The articles and posts on this website are my own and don’t necessarily represent the positions, strategies, or opinions of my employer or its subsidiaries. I make no representations as to the accuracy or completeness of any information found here or by following any links.

# Website license
All original content (e.g., articles, blog posts, illustrations, artwork, and photographs) available on this site is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License unless otherwise noted. Basically this means you are free to share, transmit, distribute, alter, transform, and build on my work as long as you don’t use it for commercial purposes without my prior written consent.

# Attribution
If you’re inclined to give credit — a link back to the source article attributed to either Made Mistakes or Michael Rose is good enough for me. If you don’t want to attribute my content, hey that’s cool too. Just don’t go stealing stuff and republishing it as your own.

# Disclosure policy
I do not make money on this website through any affiliate programs nor advertising networks. This site is to document my case studdies only. 

# What this means for you:
I became an affiliate to earn revenue towards the costs of running and maintaining this website. Where I have direct control over which ads are served on this website I offer only products that are directly related to the topics of this website and products that a reader/subscriber would have a genuine interest in or need of.
I do not and will not recommend a product for the sake of making money.
I do not let the compensation I receive influence the content, posts, or opinions expressed on this website.
I respect and value my readers too much to write anything other than my own opinions and advice.
Like this website, my disclosure policy is a work in progress. As the revenue streams evolve, so will this page.

# Privacy policy
This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected and how it is used on the website. This website does not share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law or protect my rights.
